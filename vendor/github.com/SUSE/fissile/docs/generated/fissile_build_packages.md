## fissile build packages

Builds BOSH packages in a Docker container.

### Synopsis



This command will compile all required packages in the BOSH releases referenced by
your role manifest. The command will create a compilation container named
`<repository>-cbase-<FISSILE_VERSION>-<RELEASE_NAME>-<RELEASE_VERSION>-pkg-<PACKAGE_NAME>`
for each package (e.g. `fissile-cbase-1.0.0-cf-217-pkg-nats`).

All containers are removed, whether compilation is successful or not. However, if
the compilation is interrupted during compilation (e.g. sending SIGINT), containers
will most likely be left behind.

Compiled packages are stored in `<work-dir>/compilation`. Fissile uses the
package's fingerprint as part of the directory structure. This means that if the
same package (with the same version) is used by multiple releases, it will only be
compiled once.

      --docker-network-mode string   Specify network mode to be used when building with docker. e.g. "--docker-network-mode host" is equivalent to "docker run --network=host"
      --only-releases string         Build only packages for the given release names; comma separated.
      --roles string                 Build only packages for the given role names; comma separated.
  -s, --stemcell string              The source stemcell
      --without-docker               Build without docker; this may adversely affect your system.  Only supported on Linux, and requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
