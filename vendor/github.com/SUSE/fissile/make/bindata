# Further see the code after 'exit' for the original commands to use

# We have to use just the directory, i.e. "./scripts/compilation" to
# get the correct asset names in the output. This forces us to ensure
# that the .go files in that directory are not bundled into the
# assets, especially not the generated file itself. Given the small
# size of scripts.go, we leave it in.
